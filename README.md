# Battleship

The game Battleship was created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It can be played [here.](https://adrianferenc.github.io/Battleship/)

# How The Game Is Played:
In this game, you play battleship against an AI. The game works in 2 main stages. The first stage is where you place your 5 ships onto the 10x10 grid. In the second stage, each player (you & AI) go back and forth picking squares on the grid where each believe their opponent has put a ship. When an entire ship is sunk, the other player is alerted. The game proceeds until one player's ships are all sunk, at which point the other player wins.

## A Brief History of Battleship:
The game of Battleship was originally a game played with paper and pencil. It dates back to World War I, where it is questionably disputed if it was created by the French or the Russions.

In 2012, the film Battleship (a movie I have not seen) came out, starring Taylor Kitsch, Alexander Skarsg√•rd, Rihanna, Brooklyn Decker, Tadanobu Asano, and Liam Neeson. It has a 34% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Some _fun_ facts about the film (via IMDb):

- The film utilized 600 extras.
- The film was originally set to be filmed off Australia's Gold Coast. Due to problems with government tax incentives, filming moved to Hawaii.
- Jeremy Renner was cast as Alex Hopper, but dropped out to co-star in The Master (2012), of which he also dropped out.
- The spectrum analyzer used to get the transmission through is an Anritsu MS2713E Spectrum Master.


## Icebox
- Set names of cached elements to define dom elements faster.
- Put outlines around the outside of the ships when placed on the board using border-top-style, border-left-style, etc.
- If in stage 1, clicking on a ship that has been placed removes it from the board and puts it back at the top of the shipyard.



## My Game

### Stage 1: Placing ships on your board.
- Features of this stage:
	- Player's board where the ships are placed. The board is made up of 100 squares, each with their own id and associated object which stores necessary information. The ship will have a position which is where the top of the ship will be, as well as a direction, which indicates where the rest of the ship goes. 
	- A "shipyard" with the ships that have not been placed yet and can be selected. By default the topmost ship is autoselected. When a ship is hovering over the board, the squares that would be occupied change color.
	- A button that rotates the currently selected ship. It changes the orientation property of the ship.
	- A button that undoes placing a ship and puts it back in the shipyard. It removes the position property of the ship and adds it back to the shipyard div.
	- A start button that only works once all the ships are placed. 

### Stage 2: Playing against AI
- This stage has two parts, one where player makes a move, one where AI makes a move.
- Featuers of this stage:
	- Two boards, the player board, which has the player's ships visible to them, and the AI board, where the player places their moves
	- A "FIRE!" button which locks in the player's move (may remove this)
	- Game updates with text indicating if the shot is a hit or a miss, and whether a hit causes a ship to sink (e.g. "You sunk my battleship!")
- Features of AI board:
	- Ability to click on an unplayed square to select it
	- Ability to click the square again to unselect it
	- Pressing the "FIRE!" button locks in player"s move and lets AI play a turn.
	- Different coloring of squares if the shot is a hit or a miss
- Features of player board:
	- AI moves are displayed on the board. The AI will pick a move next to a hit if it exists. If there are no hits, the AI will find one of the squares that has the most open space above/below/left/right.
	- Display is different if the shot is a hit or a miss.
	- A ship"s visual representation changes when it is sunk.
- The game will recognize when one of the team's ships have all been sunk and declare the other player the winner.


## Pseudocode:

- Stage 1
	- Set up a board for the player and the ships that can be placed on it.
	- Clicking a ship and then a square on the board places the ship on the board.
	- Once all the ships are placed, the start button is enabled and can be clicked, which leads to stage 2.

- Stage 2
	- Player and AI take turns guessing where their ships are.
	- When a player clicks, it shows as a hit or a miss by the color the square changes to.
	- The same happens with the AI.
	- The AI's strategy is to pick the most available spot based on available spots to the left, right, up, and down. Once it hits something, it searches adjacent spots until it hits again and then continues in that direction until it misses. It then goes back to the spot where it first hit and searches other adjacent squares. 
	- If a ship is sunk, its color turns a dark blue.
	- After each move, the move is written in the game update section. 
	- Once a player wins, the game indicates which player has won, how many games each player has won, and offers to play a new game.
