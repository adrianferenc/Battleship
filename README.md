# Battleship

#How The Game Is Played:
In this game, you will play battleship against an AI. The game works in 2 main stages. The first stage is where the human player places their 5 ships onto their 10x10 grid. Then the second stage starts where each player (human player & AI) go back and forth picking squares on the grid where they believe their opponent has put a ship. When an entire ship is sunk, the other player is alerted. The game proceeds until one player's ships are all sunk, at which point the other player wins.

## A Brief History of Battleship:
The game of Battleship was originally a game played with paper and pencil. It dates back to World War I, where it is questionably disputed if it was created by the French or the Russions.

In 2012, the film Battleship (a movie I have not seen) came out, starring Taylor Kitsch, Alexander Skarsg√•rd, Rihanna, Brooklyn Decker, Tadanobu Asano, and Liam Neeson. It has a 34% rating on Rotten Tomatoes' Tomatometer. Some fun facts about the film (via IMDb):

- The convenience store break-in at the beginning is a parody of a security video posted on YouTube, which went viral, of an actual liquor store break-in. Like the film, the robber climbed from the back of the store and fell down to the same spots from the ceiling twice. Both have the same camera angles and details, such as the foam and ceiling pieces falling down.
- The film utilized 600 extras.
- The film was originally set to be filmed off Australia's Gold Coast. Due to problems with government tax incentives, filming moved to Hawaii.
- Jeremy Renner was cast as Alex Hopper, but dropped out to co-star in The Master (2012), of which he also dropped out.
- The spectrum analyzer used to get the transmission through is an Anritsu MS2713E Spectrum Master.
